			    My non-robotic interests:
        </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				 <b>Fitness</b>. It's so easy to put our health lower on our list of priorities, especially as a developer - so it's essential to do. But really, I just love lifting weights around...
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Really nice cars</b>. I think everyone has a car they like looking at, even <i>a little bit more<i>, than other cars. I love to spend time learning about my own and finding something new to do to it!
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Hardware</b>. I've always loved computer hardware since I was born, there's just something really cool about it. Pictures of my new build available on request (Really, please ask â˜º).
      </li>

          OpenGidget is an open-source fork of Raspbian Linux that makes it easier to auto-provision a headless Raspberry PI,
          get it onto your WiFi network, and deploy simple Python and Ruby scripts that run at startup - all without needing to plug in a keyboard/monitor.
